Hello and welcome to the bottom of the sea.
Is anybody hungry.
No? Too early, you say. Nonsense its always a good time for a Krabby Patty.

Choose Location - Bikini Bottom
Everybody say "Hi" to virtual Squidward 

add a new customer - Tristan, password
The customer should be able to purchase multiple products
place orders to store locations for customers

Choose Location - Tentacle Acres
Plankton hired me to get the Secret Formula for Krabby Patties
All I have to do is trick virtual Squidward into thinking I'm Mr. Krabs
Sign in as 'Krabs'
I don't want virtual Squidward to catch on so I'll ask a few routine questions first 
search customers by name - Tell me about Patrick Star
display details of an order
view order history of customer

Virtual Squidward has no idea I'm not the real Mr. Krabs, one more question and I'll go in for the kill
view order history of location
view location inventory
The manager should be able to replenish inventory

At last, time to find out the Secret Formula
"It's a secret"
Argh, foiled again. Damn that Krab and his impecable security

Order histories should have the option to be sorted by date (latest to oldest and vice versa) or cost (least expensive to most expensive)


Exception Handling - Tried to catch all potential inputs in menu
Input validation
Logging (to a file, no logging to the console)
At least 10 unit tests
Data should be persisted, (no data should be hard coded)
You should use a DB to store data
DB structure should be 3NF
Should have an ER Diagram
Code should have xml documentation
